tekPad is a tiny in-game lua editor inspired by "TinyPad":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4417-TinyPad.html (yes, my pad is tiny-er).  Basically I stripped out the multi-page stuff because I found that I only used the last page of code... thus I had a bunch of old snippets of code I was never going to use again floating around in my savedvars.  I also removed the searching and frame moving resizing...

In short, this is an editbox with a button to run the lua you input, nothing more.

To access the panel you can use the "LDB launcher":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wikis or the commands @/pad@ and @/tekpad@

This addon uses "AddonLoader":http://www.wowace.com/wiki/AddonLoader if present to defer loading until the launcher or slash command are used.
