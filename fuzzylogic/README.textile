FuzzyLogic condenses Mend, Call, Dismiss and Revive Pet down into a single keybind or macro. FuzzyLogic is smart enough to know if your pet is dead, even if it's corpse has despawned. Mend pet is cast if your pet's HP% is < 90%.

FuzzyLogic will only load on hunters, it will disable itself if loaded on any other class.

The preferred means of triggering FuzzyLogic is a simple macro: @/click FuzzyLogicFrame@

h2. Other settings

If you wish to change the threshold for Mend/Dismiss pet out of combat, edit this line of FuzzyLogic.lua: @local healthresh = 0.90@

To use a keybind instead of a macro, edit this line in FuzzyLogic.lua: @local binding@<br>
For example, to bind to Ctrl-P: @local binding = "CTRL-P"@
